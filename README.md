# Why am I using Session to store the display name?

I understand that this project emphasises working with **localStorage**, however, it can be manipulated by a user, which would result in two people being online with the same display name, which is unacceptable. This is why I chose to use Session to store the username and localStorage to store the channel that user was in lately.
